RFM analysis is a powerful technique used by companies to better understand customer behaviour and optimize engagement strategies. It revolves around three key dimensions: recency, frequency, and monetary value.These dimensions capture essential aspects of customer transactions, providing valuable information for segmentation and personalized marketing campaigns.

## Customer Segmentation
Customer segmentation is the practice of dividing a customer base into groups of individuals that are similar in specific ways relevant to marketing, such as age, gender, interests and spending habits.

### Here are some of the main benefits of customer segmentation:

a. Targeted marketing messages to the right people
b. Focuses on the most profitable customers
c. It can improve customer service

## groups customers based on their transaction history :

1. Recency — How recently did the customer purchase?
2. Frequency — How often do they purchase?
3. Monetary Value — How much do they spend?

Combining and grouping them into different customer segments for easy recall and campaign targeting. It’s super useful in understanding the responsiveness of your customers and for segmentation driven database marketing.

The resulting segments can be ordered from most valuable (highest recency, frequency, and value) to least valuable (lowest recency, frequency, and value). Identifying the most valuable RFM segments can capitalize on chance relationships in the data used for this analysis


## Versions of the RFM Model
RFM is a simple framework to quantify customer behaviour. Many people have extended the RFM segmentation model and created variations.

### Two notable versions are:

i. RFD (Recency, Frequency, Duration) — Duration here is time spent. Particularly useful while analyzing consumer behaviour of viewership/readership/surfing oriented products.
ii. RFE (Recency, Frequency, Engagement) — Engagement can be a composite value based on time spent on a page, pages per visit, bounce rate, social media engagement etc. Particularly useful for online businesses.

You can perform RFM for your entire customer base, or just a subset. For example, you may first segment customers based on a geographical area or other demographics, and then by RFM for historical, transaction-based behaviour segments.
